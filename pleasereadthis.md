# pocket-calculator

When I began editing the pocket calculator directly from Github, everything looked fine. While I was changing the CSS, GitHub erased the buttons and now I can't see anything. I don't know if it's just on my computer, but now half of the page is gone when I publish it. I was wondering if commit 713c7f0c76a3b50a99cdd68e7ea7038483ca3919 could be graded instead of the most recent ones, because GitHub is no longer letting me edit any of the pages.
